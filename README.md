This is the [Artizen Fund](https://artizen.fund) Season 6 pitch deck for **Techne at RegenHub**, created for fundraising during [ETHBoulder 2026](https://ethboulder.com).

## What is Techne?

*Techne* (Greek): the craft of making — the knowledge that brings something into being.

Techne Institute is a technology learning center built on [Doug Engelbart's augmentation framework](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/) (H-LAM/T). We develop **collective intelligence** — groups thinking better together through shared tools, language, and practice — rather than simply training individuals to use AI tools.

The institute occupies the third floor above [RegenHub](https://regenhub.xyz), a co-working cooperative that has operated the second floor at 1515 Walnut for two years. Together they form a vertical ecosystem: co-working and ventures below, learning and contemplative practice above, community gathering on the roof.

## What is Artizen Fund?

[Artizen](https://artizen.fund) funds public goods through community-driven matching. Contributions to projects are matched 1:1, amplifying impact. This pitch deck presents our case to funders during Season 6.

## Programs

- **AI Building Cohorts** — Foundations → Practice → Mastery
- **Morning Practice** — Meditation, tai chi, contemplative movement
- **Arts Integration** — Creative practice as a way of knowing

## Ethereum Localism

Techne at RegenHub is also Boulder's Ethereum community hub. Home of ETHBoulder.
