## 2. Questions

### What are you making? (250 char limit — 192 chars)

> A technology learning center and Ethereum hub in downtown Boulder. People learn to build together here — software, cooperatives, local economies — with shared desks, tools, and weekly mentors.

### How will your project impact the world? (250 char limit — 181 chars)

> Boulder has talent but no commons-owned space for builders. Techne makes Ethereum infrastructure, civic tech, and cooperative economics skills you can practice, not just read about.

### What progress have you made? (250 char limit — 188 chars)

> RegenHub has run co-working and events on the second floor for two years. We incorporated as a Colorado cooperative in 2026 and built commons.id. Now expanding upstairs to triple capacity.

### Why are you the right person? (250 char limit — 184 chars)

> Todd Youngblood spent two years growing RegenHub into Boulder's regenerative tech hub. A design engineer and co-op organizer, he bridges Ethereum's global vision with local commitment.

## 3. Artifact

**Guidance for the visual:**
The Artifact should capture the *vibe* of Techne — not marketing, not a logo. Ideas:

- **A photograph of the third floor space** as it exists now — raw potential, windows, the view of the Flatirons
- **The view from 1515 Walnut** — where the Great Plains meet the Rockies at 5,430 feet
- **The building exterior** at golden hour — the physical place where this happens

Must be square, JPG/PNG/GIF, max 10MB. No text, no logos, no overlays.
